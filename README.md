## Details about the Project

PromptWaves is a simple website with a few pages. The main page is a list of all the prompts that have been submitted by users. Users can sign up or log in to submit their own prompts. Each prompt has a title, a description, and a rating. Users can upvote or downvote prompts to help others find the best ones.

## Details about the Usage of Every Technology Used in the Project

**Next.js** is a React framework that makes it easy to build server-rendered websites. This means that PromptWaves is fast and SEO-friendly.

**JavaScript** is the programming language used to build PromptWaves. JavaScript is used to create the user interface, handle user input, and make API requests.

**NextAuth** is a library that makes it easy to add authentication to a Next.js website. NextAuth uses OAuth 2.0 to allow users to sign in with their Google, GitHub, or Twitter accounts.

**MongoDB** is a database that is used to store the prompts that have been submitted by users. MongoDB is a NoSQL database, which means that it does not have a fixed schema. This makes it easy to store different types of data, such as text, images, and videos.

**Tailwind CSS** is a utility-first CSS framework that makes it easy to style a website. Tailwind CSS provides a set of classes that can be used to style elements on a page.
